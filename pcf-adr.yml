        title: Activity Data Record
        summary: An information record about an activity performed in the system for a user equipment (UE) - a device used directly by an end-user to communicate.
        description: >
          <details>
          <summary><u>ADR and LDR context:</u></summary>
          <b>LDR (Local Data Record)</b> is a local record created by an activity that occurs in the system with all the information arising from that activity. Contains a large amount of information in order to include resubmissions for correction and cancellation of actions, but also for diagnostic purposes.
          <br>
          Some activities may generate a sequence of LDRs due to event updates during the activity (<b>session scenarios</b>). When an update is required, if the activity's last LDR was not yet published, this LDR is modified with the event's information. If it was already published, a new LDR is created with the event's information and the context of the last LDR.
          <br>
          Each system participates in diverse <b>business processes</b> with multiple activities (process = Î£ activities). Since each activity generates one or more LDRs, different LDRs created by different systems are enforced to be correlative to group LDRs from the same business process.
          <p>
          <b>ADR (Activity Data Record)</b> is a LDR conversion. It is generated from one LDR and published externally, for third-party systems. While LDRs are hardcoded in the own system (non-parameterizable), the structure of ADRs is decided by parameterization, via OMS (Operational & Maintenance System), with versioning. 
          <br>
          Depending on the <b>ADR type/scenario</b>, some fields may be absent or optional. There are multiple types of ADRs, commonly grouped as follows: 
          <ul>
          <li> <b>service</b> ADRs, which include <code>SMPolicyControl</code>, <code>PolicyAuthorization</code>, and <code>Charging</code> activities;
          <li> <b>provision</b> ADRs, which includes <code>AccountManagement</code>, <code>ProductManagement</code>, and <code>BucketManagement</code> activities; and
          <li> <b>top-up</b> ADRs.
          </ul>
          In terms of scenarios, there are two:
          <ul>
          <li> <b>single event</b> scenarios, which include <code>Unique</code> events (e.g., <b>provision</b> ADRs, <b>top-up</b> ADRs); and
          <li> <b>session</b> scenarios, which include <code>Initial</code>, <code>Intermediate</code>, and <code>Final</code> events (e.g., <b>service</b> ADRs).
          </ul>

                _Example:_ When the ASM receives a request for a provision activity, it has to create an LDR with a `correlationId` and propagate that to the CCS and PCF systems. These systems will then create their own LDRs with the same `correlationId`.

                _Example:_ When a set of accounts are connected to a reseller account (meaning that every account, including the reseller account, has the `billingAccountId` equal to the reseller account identifier) the billing is unified on a single invoice belonging to the reseller account.
